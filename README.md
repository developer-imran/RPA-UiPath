# RPA-UiPath

My RPA-UiPath experiments,

This Repository contains Processes & Certificates, Processes I have created while I was working & practicing it & get certified during training period, and now I am RPA developer.
I am in this environment since 1 year being the part of Automation using UiPath studio and Orchestrator, the reason is I am so much excited to work real-time , that I can convert huge bulk of business work into working bots to finish the process in minimum amount of time that human being can't do.

check out repository contents.
